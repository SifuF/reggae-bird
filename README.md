## Run in simulator
Download and install [**CoronaSDK/Solar2d**](https://solar2d.com/) and clone the Reggae Bird repo into a folder called ```reggae-bird``` inside the project directory (the default location on Windows is ```/Documents/Corona Projects```). Start the newly installed Corona Simulator -> open project, and navigate to the ```main.lua``` file in the ```reggae-bird``` directory.

## Build APK
Once the game is running in the simulator, file -> build -> Android will create an APK that can be installed on any Android device (you will need to check 'untrusted sources' in your device settings).
